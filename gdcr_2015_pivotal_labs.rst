Prepare docker image for presentation by executing::

    docker build --tag gdcr_at_pivotal:latest .

You can render this presentation to HTML with the command::

    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 gdcr_at_pivotal

Presentation is available under your local address::

    http://localhost:8000

We need::

    Flipcharts for 4 rules x2 , Conway's game of life rules x2

Don't forget about::

    WIFI credentials

    Twitter hashtag

TO DO ON DAY:

    PLUGINS

    PRINT RULES AND PLACE ON THE WALL

    ARRANGE CAMERA

TODO:

    Prepare GIST with all practices (also with not included in the presentation)

    Add some notes to the slides (find TODO)

Why are we here today
=====================

* Learn

* Practice

* Experiment

* Get out of our comfort zone

.. note::


    * New Language

    * TDD, BDD or any other technique.

    * Tools

    * Share Knowledge

    * Expose to new ideas

----

Coderetreat is ...
==================

    * One day event

    * Practice fundamentals

    * 6 sessions

    * Different pair for each session

    * One constraint in each session

.. note::

    TDD, BDD, OO, functional paradigm, clean code.
    You define what is important for you.

----

:data-y: r1000

Structure of the day
====================

    * 15 minutes intro
    * 3 sessions of 45min
    * 15min retro after each session
    * 1 hour lunch
    * 3 sessions of 45min
    * 15min retro after each session
    * 15 minutes closing circle

HOWTO
=====

    * Choose your pair

    * Choose your language

    * Focus on practice

    * We don't have to finish

    * DELETE YOUR CODE

    * Be respectful

.. note::

    How you solved problem is not so important as the lesson you learnt

----

4 rules of good design
======================

    * Tests Pass

    * Express Intent

    * No Duplication

    * Small

.. note::

    * Passes all the tests.

    * Express every idea we need to express.

    * Contains no duplication. DRY

    * Minimized the number of classes, methods and other moving parts.

:id: gameOfLife

Conway's Game of Life
=====================

    * A **live cell** having less than 2 live neighbors *dies*

    * A **live cell** having 2 or 3 live neighbors **lives**

    * A **live cell** having more than 3 neighbors *dies*

    * A *dead* cell having 3 neighbors becomes **alive**


.. note::

    The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
    each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead.

    Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

Let's play
==========

    * Verbs instead of Nouns

    * Mute with Find the Loophole

    * Code Swap

.. note::

    TODO Add more about "Verbs instead of Nouns"
    Mute with Find the Loophole

    This is a pairing exercise. It is actually three pairing techniques brought together in one exercise.

    * Ping-pong - one person writes the tests, the other person writes the implementation code
    * Mute - nobody can talk
    * Find the Loophole - (AKA evil coder) the implementation person purposely writes the wrong algorithm that still makes the tests turn green. The key is that they have to keep the code very clean all the while. So, no big long if statements parsing on the input parameters.

    Code swap

    Each developer starts at their machine and is given 20 minutes to solve the kata. At the end of twenty minutes someone calls time and everyone gets up from their machine and rotates to the next workstation.
